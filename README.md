# Project: Amazon Clone with ReactJS, Firebase, Git and GitHub, Stripe Payment Gateway

As a self-taught developer, I undertook a personal project to build a web application that replicated the functionality of Amazon. I used ReactJS along with Firebase for authentication and database management, Git and GitHub for version control, and Stripe as a payment gateway.

Throughout the project, I prioritized writing clean and modular code, following industry best practices, and learning new skills as needed. I implemented a range of features, including user authentication, a shopping cart, product detail pages and payment processing.

I also integrated Stripe for payment processing, allowing users to securely purchase items on the website. Using Git and GitHub, I tracked changes to the codebase and collaborated with others on the project.

I developed the application using VS Code, taking advantage of its advanced features for code editing and debugging. The end result was a high-quality web application that closely replicated the user experience of Amazon.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my skills in front-end development, back-end development, and project management, as well as gain experience with popular industry tools such as Git and Stripe.
